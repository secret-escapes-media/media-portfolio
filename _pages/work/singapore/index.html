  <p class="text--xl">Singapore Tourism Board sought to increase travellers’ length-of-stay during a stopover. We created a true local’s four-day itinerary, written by our Asia editor and Singapore resident, Jessica Little. Secret Escapes offers were sourced that included four-night stays or a four-day stopover in Singapore. YoY we saw an increase in avg. length of stay with room nights up 100% because of the activity. </p>
