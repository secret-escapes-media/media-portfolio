challenge: >
  <p>Align the new Lexus UX with some of Secret Escapes most design-forward properties, complementing the unique style of the car and highlighting its purpose as the perfect urban-escape automobile. Generate test drives and capture data, and create assets that Lexus dealerships can use. Launch localised content in six markets.</p>

solution: >
  <p>We created a bespoke Design Collection, sourcing our finest city-based design hotels and crafting localised design-loverâ€™s city guides for each territory. This theme was fully explored in the two hero videos we made (one for the UK, one for EU), which showed our influencer experience a design getaway to two cities, staying at incredible Secret Escapes hotels, all facilitated by the Lexus UX. </p>
