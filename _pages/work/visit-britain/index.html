intro: >
  <p class="text--xl">Visit Britain presented a unique challenge for us to inspire our members to maximise their weekends, by embarking on adventures and experiences in the UK â€“ the microgap. We showcased a range of curious and inspiring experiences and crafted our own, fully tailored, bookable microgap weekends offering more experience-plus-hotel packages. We increased these offerings by 357% (YoY) and saw an uplift in bookings of 119% (YoY on experience packages). </p>
