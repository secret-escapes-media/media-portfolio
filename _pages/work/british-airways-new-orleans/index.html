challenge: >
  <p>Taking our learnings from the previous New Orleans hub, we needed to build on our content offering and create a new way to promote the destination to our members. We also needed to promote the direct route British Airways were offering, and tie in bookable holidays so our members were inspired to book their own NOLA experience. </p>

solution: >
  <p>We picked four themes proven to resonate with our members, creating an inspirational guide with local’s tips included to underpin our hero piece – a video guide to the city, presented by our editor. The content was supported by CTAs making it clear that British Airways offered the best way to reach the city, with a ‘holidays’ page packed with tempting deals. </p>
