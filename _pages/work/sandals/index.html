  <p class="text--xl">Weâ€™ve worked with Sandals for the past three years, allowing us to constantly improve our offering and increase the conversions they seek when working with us. Our latest campaign was unique in the sense that we hosted the Sandals holiday offers directly on Secret Escapes. This improved integration saw a YoY increase in total bookings generated over the campaign period.</p>
